# tools4reionisation
Various tools useful for reionisation: 

In folder ./star_formation_history, you will find what you need to compute star formation history from galaxy luminosity functions

In folder ./comprehensive_scenario, you will find an MCMC algorithm to fit reionisation parametrisation to data (xHII, Planck tau and star formation history), according to  Gorce et al., 2018, Astronomy & Astrophysics, 616, A113 (arXiv:1710.04152)

In folder ./ksz_power, you will find what you need to compute the kSZ angular power spectrum from a few reionisation parameters (zre, zend) (arXiv:2004.06616)
